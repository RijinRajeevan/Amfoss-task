## MY APPROACH :
So in the task 3,I firstly revised the topic the basics of python which i already studied in my high school.I didn't struggle that much and finded out the logic easily.acoording to me we have to apply the same logic in every other languages.also as i learnt some basics of java before I didn't struggle that much but i referred some youtube videos which teached me a lot more about the subtask 2 which i was not familiar.like this i completed the python,c and java.Other programming languages I only did the hello world part as i could not spend more time on it.I reffered freecodecamo.org youtube leatures.
